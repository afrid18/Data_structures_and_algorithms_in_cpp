# _Data Structures and Algorithms using C++_
    
> Hello Learners,
>
>> I have started this project to learn DSA using C++ the hard way.
>> I believe the only way you can clearly understand, is when you do everything your self.
>> All beginners are welcome, and are free to contribute and help me solve the problems of this text book.


### Contributing rules!
* Code should have the clear documentation about what it is solving.
* Every question should be alloted a new file and there must be question at the start of the file.
* There should be there folders each for **Reinforcement**,  **Creativity** and **Projects**.
