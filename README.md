# _Data Structures and Algorithms using C++_
    
**Hello Learners,**
 I have started this project to learn DSA using C++ the hard way.
 I believe the only way you can clearly understand, is when you do everything your self.
 All beginners are welcome, and are free to contribute and help me solve the problems of this text book.


### Contributing rules!
* Code should have the clear documentation about what it is solving.
* Every question should be alloted a new file and there must be question at the start of the file.
* There should be there folders each for **Reinforcement**,  **Creativity** and **Projects**.

### Contributing structure of the each chapter and each topic of the chapter should aling with the pattern shown below
For example, consider **chapter 5**, has stack as a topic, and that topic has sub-topics like ArrayStack, LinkedList Stack, etc,. Then the following pattern is used for all the relevent structuring

```
chapter_5
â””â”€â”€ stack
    â”œâ”€â”€ ArrayStack
    â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ ArrayStack.cpp
    â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ ArrayStack.h
    â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ ArrayStackTest.cpp
    â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ Makefile
```
